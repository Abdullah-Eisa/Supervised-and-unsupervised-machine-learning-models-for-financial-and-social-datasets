# Supervised-and-unsupervised-machine-learning-models-for-financial (Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) shuffled dataset)-and-social (Student performance)-datasets

- Applying inferential statistics and EDA to explore student performance dataset and trying to  predict G3 not given G1, nor G2 using Python.

- Applying data visualization to show insights from data distribution in student performance dataset.


## Dataset

- student performance dataset from Portuguese schools, available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance


## Major Steps
- using EDA and popular libraries like: `Numpy` , `pandas`,`sklearn` and `matplotlib` to investigate and viasualize data.
- using `Xgboost` and `Gradient boosting ` and other models to predict student performance associated characterstics.

## Featured results

- As the age increase, the performance of students decreases.

- Alcohol consumption decreases student performance.
